Beginner - Practise.

Hi GitHub. I'm Milton. Currently, I'm aspiring to become a designer, more specificcally a furniture designer. But before I can venture on to that journey, I have to practise a few different design skills, and I was hoping I could take up some really simplistic web-design coding, so that I could in the end build my own webpage. Or at least, learn a few things about it.
